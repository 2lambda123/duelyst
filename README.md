guide will also enable you to play local single player games while we work on the reference deployment.

## Reference Deployment

OpenDuelyst will soon be deployed as "Duelyst Classic": a version of the game exactly as it was in v1.96.17, before the
servers were shut down. This work is currently in progress.

## Client/Server Architecture

For client and server architecture documentation, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Filing Issues and Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug and would like to report it, first check the
[Open Issues](https://github.com/open-duelyst/duelyst/issues/) to see if the bug has already been reported. If not,
feel free to create a new issue with the `bug` label.

If you would like to request a technical feature or enhancement to the code, you can create a new issue with the
`enhancement` label.

Since OpenDuelyst is currently focused on recreating the game as it last existed in v1.96.17, please avoid creating
feature requests related to balance changes.
